Just another repository

Hello guys, I'm 15 y/o, going to high school and love programming, but I don't really know how to teach myself, so I expect this place will help me. I only know a little bit of C++ in Codeblocks but I've seen that the C++ coding in some other IDEs like Visual Studio is a bit different and I am a bit confused about that.
